 # üëì CHEAT code :
 (sorry don't work in exam at 42)
   
   **remove_grade_time** : remove grade time between two push
   
      > The maximum time to complete the exam is only information. 
      Here, the exercise can always be corrected even after the time limit.
      
   **force_success** : force an exercice to success
   
   **new_ex** : generate a new exercice on the same level
  


 You can contribute by adding new exercises or improving the program 
 
   **gradenow** : Get an instant correction (no grademe cooldown)
   
  > Being a sponsor brings VIP on GradeMe and 42_EXAM.
  
  > VIPs also have exactly the same display as the 42 examshell.
  
  > More features coming

# Disclaimer for 1337 staff :

This project is not identical to the proposed exams and does not reflect 42 official exam. 
It is only meant to help 42 students to train on some exercises found on Github. 
It works simply by doing a DIFF on both versions. 
All the subjects have been found on Github. During my schooling at 42, this project helped me to understand a lot of notions like how to host a website, working with javascript, php and others.
This project has been created with the sole purpose of helping students to understand their mistakes and improve themselves. 
If It‚Äôs not the case, I am ready to make changes and corrections on it, 42_EXAM/GradeMe has only a non-lucrative and educational purpose. It is completely free and open-source.
if you find this project is a cheating just contact me i will remove it froma here
